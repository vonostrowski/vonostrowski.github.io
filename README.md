This is the new multi-platform version of the guidelines (Kompendium) for students in mathematics education that the mathematics education working group at the Department 03 of the University of Bremen has previously published as a PDF. It is authored by Thomas Jan√üen, my contact information is given in this Github profile.

Work is always in progress. You can find the preview of the next version of the Kompendium at https://janssent.github.io/kompendium-bkdwn/. A formally published version is available at the homepage of the AG Didaktik (http://www.math.uni-bremen.de/didaktik/).

You may use the Kompendium as an open educational resource and edit your own version with R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). Please see the page "[Get Started](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html)" at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ for an introduction.
